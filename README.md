# Car_Accident_Prediction_Machine_Learning_

# Data description
Road accidents are one of the major causes of unnatural deaths around the world. We used Machine Learning with the objecting of measuring how influential certain factors can be in accidents taking place in the hopes of reducing the amount and severity in the future.
In this project we classify the severity of road accidents based off of different factors (sex, weather, time of day,etc). The data was collected from vehicle collisions in Ethiopia ranging from 2017-2020.  All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.

# Problem Statement
The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each day's task

# Technical Process used
Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
Random Forrest Model 
K-Nearest Neighbors Model
